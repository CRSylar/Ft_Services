# Ft_Services

![Cromalde's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/cromalde/Ft_services)

Docker & Kubernetes project

In this project we have to set up a cluster using docker containers running different services and an orchestrator ( Kubernetes )
We can't use pre-builded images so we need to create ours starting from the scratch ( alpine linux )

ATTENTION :

After a security update of all the version of alpine this project maybe not working correctly without some changes
